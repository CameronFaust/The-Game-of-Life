So I've messed with if for a few minutes and have got github functional!

Just follow this tutorial to the t!

http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/

I am personnaly a fan of GUI's so the way I have found to push a file is like this.[This is assuming you have already completed the tutorial successfully]

1. Make any changes to your local files.

2. Open Git GUI.

3. Click the 'Rescan' button.
 3a. Your changes will show in the 'Unstaged Changes' list box.

4. Click the 'State Changed' button.
	4a. If you are adding files it will ask you about unknown files. Click 'Yes'.

5. Type your commit message. [What you changed reason etc.]

6. Click the 'Commit' button.

7. If all goes well click the 'Push' button.

8. Select your branch. [This is to make it so all our changes are separate, I am pretty sure we can merge the branches too]

9. Click 'Push'.
